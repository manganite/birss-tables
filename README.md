# Birss Symmetry & Magnetism — Transcription Project

Markdown transcriptions of selected tables from:

> R. R. Birss, *Symmetry and Magnetism*, North-Holland / Elsevier, 1966.
> Free online access: [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/details/symmetrymagnetis0000robe)

The source PDF (`Birss Symmetry & Magnetism komplett.pdf`) contains many tables printed rotated 90° or split across pages, making them difficult to read. This project digitises the key reference tables into clean, cross-referenced Markdown.

## Files

| File | Contents |
|---|---|
| `conventions-reference.md` | Master reference: coordinate conventions, notation systems (HM / Schoenflies / Shubnikov), the σ(0)–σ(9) generating matrix pool, tensor type definitions (polar/axial, i-/c-tensor), and the complete cross-reference guide for all tables. **Read this first.** |
| `table-3.md` | The 32 crystallographic point groups — symmetry operations, Schoenflies / HM / Shubnikov symbols, and generating matrices. |
| `table-4a.md` | Symbol-equivalence mapping: assigns each of the 32 point groups a letter symbol class (A–U) for each tensor type (polar/axial × even/odd rank). Gateway to Tables 4b–4f. |
| `table-4b.md` | Tensor forms, rank 0 (scalars) across all 32 point groups. |
| `table-4c.md` | Tensor forms, rank 1 (vectors) across all 32 point groups. |
| `table-4d.md` | Tensor forms, rank 2 across all 32 point groups. |
| `table-4e.md` | Tensor forms, rank 3 across all 32 point groups. |
| `table-4f.md` | Tensor forms, rank 4 across all 32 point groups. |
| `table-6.md` | The 90 magnetic point groups (32 classical + 58 black-and-white), with generating matrices including primed (time-reversal-combined) operations. |
| `table-7.md` | Magnetic point groups mapped to i-tensor and c-tensor symbol classes (extensions of the Table 4a scheme to magnetically ordered materials). |

## How to use

1. Start with `conventions-reference.md` to understand the notation.
2. Look up a point group in `table-3.md` to find its symbol and generating matrices.
3. Use `table-4a.md` to find the symbol class for the tensor type and rank you need.
4. Look up that symbol class in the appropriate `table-4b` through `table-4f`.

For magnetic point groups, follow the same chain starting from `table-6.md` and `table-7.md`.

> **Note on the 32 "grey" groups:** The 32 Type II (grey) magnetic point groups are omitted from Tables 6 and 7 because their i-tensors are identical to the classical groups in Table 3, and their c-tensors are identically zero.
